#in python set is basially a built in data structure in python whcih stores unordered collection of unique elements.sets are unordered,mutabable(changeable) and stores unique elements that means it will automatically delete duplicates.
shapes={"heart","square","circle","rectangle","heart"}
#set elements are always enclosed by {} brackets.
print(shapes)
#automatically deletes the duplicate element
#add elements through add()
shapes.add("trapezium")
print(shapes)
#trapezium did got added but in an unordered way
SHAPES={"rhombus","parallelogram"}
shapes.update(SHAPES)
print(shapes)
#used to add elements from any other list,string
shapes.discard("square")
print(shapes)
#discard() is ued to remove an element from the set
print(len(shapes))
a={1,2,3,4,5,6,7}
b={2,4,6,7}
print(a|b)
print(a.union(b))
#union of two sets using two different methods.
#intersection of two sets
print(a&b)
print(a.intersection(b))
#difference of two sets
print(a-b)
print(a.difference(b))
#difference of elements o two sets(not subtraction the output will display all the elements which are different)
a={1,2,3,4,5,6,87,86,44}

else:
    print('set a and b are not equal')
a.clear()
#removes all elements from that particular set
